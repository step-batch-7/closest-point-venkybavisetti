You are a single celled organism whose location is represented in two dimensions.
You have several food targets around you, whose locations are also represented in two dimensions.

Write a program, which when given the above data can determine the food target closest to the single celled organism.
Assuming that there are five food targets at:
    [18 76] [19 66] [89 57] [9 71] [55 38]

Location of organism: [18 86],  Closest food target : [18 76]
Location of organism: [97 27],  Closest food target : [89 57]
Location of organism: [69 7],   Closest food target : [55 38]
Location of organism: [10 94],  Closest food target : [18 76]
Location of organism: [36 27],  Closest food target : [55 38]
